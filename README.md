# ZooClassificationProject
Using Python to predict the class of a zoo animal based off of certain traits. 
PORTFOLIO
One project that I have worked on used data analysis and prediction algorithms to try and predict the class of a zoo animal based off of given traits, such as, has hair, has fins, is aquatic, etcâ€¦ 
For this project, we used Python and imported a few different data analysis libraries in order to run the data through three separate prediction algorithms. 
We then compared the results to see which algorithm would prove to be the most accurate. 
My role on this project was to learn how to do the above process, from the ground up, with no previous Python experience.
